A vital aspect of life is health care. Records managers utilize an online doctor-patient
management system to keep track of their client’s cases and clients’ patients. According
to estimates, a person’s health adds many years to their life expectancy. It also brings
improvements to many people’s practical abilities and high quality of life, perhaps even
more so. This is a web-based tool that allows patients to choose a doctor, examine the
available booking slots, and choose the preferable date and time for the doctor they have
chosen. Patients can even take video consultations from doctors through this system.
